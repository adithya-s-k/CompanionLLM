## Contribution Types

There are several ways you can contribute to the CompanionLLama project:

1. **Contributing to the Dataset**: Help enhance the dataset used for fine-tuning by adding more diverse and contextually rich conversations.

2. **Improving the Fine-tuning Process**: Optimize the fine-tuning process, including hyperparameter tuning and training strategies, to make the model even more effective.

3. **Enhancing Model Responses**: Work on improving the responses generated by the model to make them more natural, empathetic, and context-aware.

4. **Code Contributions**: Contribute code for various aspects of the project, including data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.

5. **Bug Fixes and Issue Reporting**: If you encounter issues or bugs, please report them by opening an issue. If you can, provide a detailed description and, if possible, steps to reproduce the problem.

## Getting Started

To begin contributing to CompanionLLama, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the [CompanionLLama repository](https://github.com/adithya-s-k/CompanionLLama) to create your copy of the repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`. Replace `[your-username]` with your GitHub username.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/CompanionLLama.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can use `pip` for this.

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution. Name it appropriately based on the type of contribution you intend to make.

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-contribution
   ```

5. **Make Changes**: Make your contributions, whether it's modifying code, adding to the dataset, or improving documentation.

6. **Testing**: Ensure your changes do not introduce errors and that existing functionality still works as expected. See [Testing](#testing) below for guidelines.

7. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

   ```shell
   git commit -m "Added feature X"  # Replace with an appropriate message
   ```

8. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

   ```shell
   git push origin my-contribution  # Replace with the branch name you created
   ```

9. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your fork to the main CompanionLLama repository. Be sure to provide a clear description of your changes.

## Contributing to the Dataset

If you want to contribute to the dataset used for fine-tuning, follow these guidelines:

- Ensure the conversations you add are diverse, contextually rich, and contribute to the goal of making the model a sentient companion.
- Use the provided [notebooks](https://github.com/adithya-s-k/CompanionLLama/tree/main/notebook) for data preparation and follow the format specified.
- Provide clear and concise documentation about the changes you make to the dataset.

## Improving the Fine-tuning Process

For those interested in optimizing the fine-tuning process, consider the following:

- Experiment with different hyperparameters and training strategies to enhance the model's performance.
- Document your findings and share insights about what works best.
- Collaborate with others to fine-tune the model more effectively.

## Enhancing Model Responses

To improve the model's responses, follow these guidelines:

- Work on making the responses more natural, empathetic, and context-aware.
- Experiment with different text generation techniques.
- Collaborate with the community to gather feedback on response improvements.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

When contributing code, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Add comments and docstrings to your code to make it more understandable.
- Ensure your code is well-documented, especially if it introduces new functionality.
- Write unit tests where applicable to maintain code quality.

## Testing

Testing is a crucial aspect of contributions. Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality and that new features work as expected. If you are adding new code, consider writing unit tests to cover the new functionality.

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you are ready to submit your contributions, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your code is pushed to your fork on GitHub.

2. Go to the [CompanionLLama repository](https://github.com/adithya-s-k/CompanionLLama).

3. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.

4. Click the "New Pull Request" button.

5. Select your fork and branch as the source for the pull request.

6. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.

7. Click the "Create Pull Request" button.

8. Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers, and feedback may be provided.

9. Once approved, your contributions will be merged into the main repository.
